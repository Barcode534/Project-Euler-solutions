# Project-Euler-solutions
PE solutions

These are my solutions to problems on https://projecteuler.net/archives

I mainly just aim to solve the problem with the first idea that comes to mind (happens ~80%). 

If I can't design a solution, I may have to research some number theory, then I try again (10%). 

Sometimes I need to see someone elses code, and if I do, I take their idea and write mine myself to ensure I get it (10%).

I've solved 58 solutions as of 30/05/2019: https://gyazo.com/5e83ecec91b3181587a3d25c67978c72

I've started doing some Leetcode.com - Completed 16 tasks there: https://gyazo.com/8d36d1565ee924e5c675a6efe614035e
