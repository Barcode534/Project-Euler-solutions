PE solutions

These are my solutions to problems on https://projecteuler.net/archives

I mainly just aim to solve the problem with the first idea that comes to mind. 

If I can't design a solution, I may have to research some number theory, then I try again. 

Sometimes I need to see someone elses code, and if I do, I take their idea and write mine myself to ensure I get it.

I've solved 22 problems as of 19/4/2019, most of them this past week: https://gyazo.com/924000e3e8c70ab244627551fd17b9b7

I will continue solving them to keep developing my skills. Thinking about it now, it may be wise to use 1 or 2 other websites to ensure I'm getting good variety of problems.
